<p><em>Open source programming underdogs may have more advantages than their
critics imagine. But whether they win or lose in the end, it's their
story that inspires.</em></p>
<p>Giving away software is a &quot;strategy of the weak.&quot; At least most
business analysts consider it so when comparing the strategy against the
&quot;embrace and extend&quot; strategies used by powerful software houses like
Microsoft.</p>
<p>But let me tell you a story that took place 584 years ago today. A
story about the weak and their strategies.</p>
<div class="section" id="act-i">
<h2>Act I</h2>
<p><img alt="image0" src="/images/crispin.jpg" /></p>
<p>On October 25, 1415, on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintc21.htm">Saint Crispin's</a>
day, a troop of tired, sick, and hungry men -- the unquestionably weak --
defeated an enemy who not only outnumbered them four-to-one but who
fought on their own turf. It was at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.optonline.com/comptons/ceo/00080_A.html">Battle of Agincourt</a>,
when
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.blockbuster.com/video/title.tin?title_id=128648">King Henry V</a>
led his troops into one of the greatest victories of military history.</p>
<p>Six thousand English soldiers were marching in retreat. Their
destination was the safe port of Calais, from whence they hoped to
escape to England. They were intercepted at Agincourt by French
Constable Charles d'Albret and a French army 25,000 strong, including
armored cavalry and infantry. Annihilation of the English troops was
imminent; they had no advantages -- except for the rain. It rained, and
rained, and rained, and the battlefield became a quagmire. Mired in mud,
the French cavalry were easy prey for the <a class="reference external" href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ecva/agincourt.htm">English
archers</a>. The heavily
armored infantry men slipped and fell. Struggling to rise they were cut
down by the hatchets, hooks, and knives of the highly mobile English
raiders.</p>
<p>For every Englishman killed, 25 French were slain. Some 500 French
noblemen died on the field. The victory paved the way for English
domination of most of France until the middle of the century.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="act-ii">
<h2>Act II</h2>
<p>Like the Constable d'Albret at Agincourt, most open source detractors
misjudge the present situation.</p>
<p>They misjudge open source programmers, accusing them of amateurism and
claiming that their only motivation is peer recognition. Critics also
jump to conclusions about where and how these programmers earn their
income, and about their knowledge and skills. The critics are in for a
surprise.</p>
<p>And like d'Albret, analysts misjudge the battlefield as well. Today's
internetworked world is fundamentally different from that on which the
current software giants built their empires. And things are changing
rapidly. Today, news of friends or foes, features or bugs, span the
world in a matter of hours. Things are fundamentally different when
anyone can post a question, and receive more than one authoritative
answer from people across the globe. Things are fundamentally different
when even your teenage son is among the ones posting the answers. Things
are fundamentally different when the computer I carry in my waist pack
is several times more powerful than the computer I learned to program
on. It's raining folks. It's pouring!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="epilogue">
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Business analysts comment with a sneer that it's easy to double your
market share every year when you start from zero. They speculate about
what will happen when the software giants feel their territory
threatened and decide to</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/msnw/linuxmyths.asp">charge</a>.
They predict victory for the corporations; the apparently strong. But in
the fast-changing world of the Internet, the advantage may well go to
those who are flexible, agile, free from corporate inertia, and brave
enough to take the risks.</p>
<p>The Hundred Years War, of which Agincourt was part, was eventually won
by the French, and the English were expelled from French territory. But
the legend of the victory at Agincourt lives on.</p>
<p>Likewise, the final outcome of the battles between the open source
advocates and traditional business may not be the most important thing.
It's the tale of open source and of the souls that fight for it that
inspires, and will therefore last.</p>
