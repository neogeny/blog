<p><em>When royalties are out of the question, programmers find innovative
ways of earning profits, such as providing value-added services. New
ways of making business out of open source are being invented every
day.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Amateurs!&quot; That's what critics call open-source programmers. And
sometimes they really mean &quot;hackers&quot;: those who lack the knowledge and
attitude required to do the job well. Well, open-source software is
<em>open</em> after all, and anyone, knowledgeable or not, can take a &quot;hack&quot; at
it. But the quality of open-source software like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bind.org/">BIND</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sendmail.org/">Sendmail</a> (on which the Internet lives and
breathes), or of the many components of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> distributions, leaves no room for
doubt: these guys know what they're doing.</p>
<p>More frequently, though, the term &quot;amateur&quot; is used in contrast to
&quot;professional&quot;; it distinguishes those who work at something for fun
from those who do the job seriously -- for a living. Last week <a class="reference external" href="http://www.neogeny.org/article/images/10550/link%20to%20saint%20crispin%27s">I
suggested</a>
that those who perceive open-source programmers to be mere hobbyists
were in for a big surprise. Well, surprise!</p>
<div class="section" id="case-studies">
<h2>Case studies</h2>
<p>Many open-source advocates are entrepreneurs. As many of you know,
open source has already produced its first round of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/tech/view/1999/10/04/marc_ewing/index.html">millionaire
techies</a>
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue67/news-editor.html">Red Hat's</a>
initial public offering. RedHat assembles and tests the thousands of
parts that compose a Linux distribution, selling the CDs and
installation support through retail channels. The company also sells
support and consulting services to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/about/1999/press_compaq2.html">corporate</a>
Linux users and distributors. The RedHat IPO is special in that
recognized open-source developers had the opportunity to get their share
of the deal through <a class="reference external" href="http://www.etrade.com/">eTrade's</a> online
brokering service. Other companies, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.turbolinux.com/">Turbo
Linux</a>, are working eagerly to get on the
same train as RedHat.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Research</a> has made it to the end of
the rainbow by selling pre-configured hardware, as well as support and
consulting services to help make the most of open-source software,
especially Linux. VA Research is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue67/news-feature-du99-vares.html">reportedly</a>
one of the fastest-growing companies in the US. There are several other
large companies and many smaller ones that provide services like those
of RedHat and VA Research.</p>
<p>Companies like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly</a> make money selling
printed versions of open-source documentation, and publications like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-mag.com/">Linux Magazine</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.portalux.com/informations/journals/">other</a> printed and
web-based publications feature articles about Linux and other
open-source software, profiting from the sale of ad space. Some of these
publications become desirable acquisitions because of their large
reading audiences. Such is the case with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/">*Linux
Today*</a>, an online publication featuring
a collection of Linux news headlines drawn from the printed and online
press. The business was
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.internetwire.com/technews/tn/tn984837.dsl">acquired</a> last
month by the larger <a class="reference external" href="http://www.internet.com/">internet.com</a>. At five
million page views and 400,000 users per month, <em>Linux Today</em> meant
business.</p>
<p>There are many other examples of businesses profiting in various ways
from open source. News of startups, acquisitions, and IPOs arrives at an
almost daily rate. You can check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/">*Linux
Today*</a> to keep informed.</p>

<div class="section" id="in-their-own-words">
<h2>In their own words</h2>
<p>&quot;But those are entrepreneurs,&quot; you might object. &quot;What about the
programmers? Are they profiting from open source?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I sought a couple of them out for comment. I caught Greg Wilkins
of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mortbay.com/">Mortbay Consulting Ltd</a>. just before he
left for a vacation trip. Greg is author of the feature-rich and very
successful <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mortbay.com/software/Jetty.html">Jetty</a>, an
open-source Web, Servlet, and JSP server written in Java. (Note: I've
contributed both code and advice to the development of Jetty.)</p>
<p>I asked Greg if Jetty was contributing to his company's revenues and,
if so, how.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Jetty contributes very little directly to our revenues -- a few
support contracts only. However, there is a big payback in terms of our
consulting work,&quot; he replied. &quot;It is a great reference and an excellent
introduction to our work, and that keeps our down time to a minimum. But
the big payoff comes from our work on projects using Jetty, for which we
receive full consulting rates -- in London and Sydney, that's 25 to 75
percent higher than normal contracting rates.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I also asked Greg why he had decided to make Jetty open-source, and
what had been the net business effects of that decision.</p>
<p>He told me that he had written Jetty as an entry to the original
<a class="reference external" href="http://http//infoseek.go.com/?win=_search&amp;sv=M6&amp;ud9=IE5&amp;qt=%22java+programming+contest%22&amp;oq=Java+programming+contest&amp;url=http%3A//www.cse.nd.edu/contest/encoded/&amp;ti=%2797+ACM+ECR+Programming+Contest%3A+Encoded+announcement⊤=17625">Java programming contest</a>
sponsored by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>, and that it had won the
Australian prize. For a few years his company reserved the rights to
commercial use. As a consulting company, though, it had neither the
resources nor the motivation to become strongly product-oriented.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;We decided that the best way to profit from Jetty was to make it as
widely used as possible,&quot; Greg confided. He said this allowed them to
get assistance with its maintenance and they believed its quality would
improve through community involvement. Greg added, &quot;And we were right.
Jetty has easily paid for itself many times over.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I also approached Chad Hower of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pbe.com/">Phoenix Business
Enterprises</a>, with whom I had recently had an
e-mail conversation. Chad is the author of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pbe.com/SourceWorks/Winshoes/">Winshoes</a> open-source set
of Internet components for Delphi. I asked Chad the same questions I'd
asked Greg.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Marketing developer tools is very hard,&quot; Chad told me, &quot;especially
those targeted at single-vendor development environments like Delphi.
There is easier money to be made elsewhere. Winshoes, like other
projects of mine, was more a product of need and love of programming
than anything else. There were no good Internet components for Delphi
when I wrote Winshoes.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Chad felt that trying to market Winshoes would have been risky. His
time, he explained, was better spent at what he did best: software
development. Having nothing to lose, he made Winshoes opensource as an
experiment. What has happened since has far exceeded his initial
expectations. Winshoes has brought the company many contract offers, as
well as frequent requests for Internet consulting work.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Many developers just sit on code like this,&quot; Chad observed. &quot;I
encourage them to make the sources open and see what happens. There's
nothing to lose, and a lot to gain.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Greg and Chad are using open source as what some call a &quot;loss-leader&quot;:
something that you give away to enable further business opportunities.
Along similar lines is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.digicool.com/">Digital Creations</a>,
a &quot;web solutions&quot; company which built its success on the full-featured
applications server currently known as<a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>.
Feeling some growing pains, Digital Creations decided to go after a
little venture capital. Finding an
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.verticality.com/Press/DigitalCreations">investor</a> was
surprisingly easy. Even more surprisingly, the investor recommended
making the flagship product open source. Digital Creations' value, he
suggested, was its know-how. The company concluded that making Zope open
source could only open new doors for them -- and it did.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="show-me-the-money">
<h2>Show me the money!</h2>
<p>But those are all entrepreneurs. They're not programmers, are they?</p>
<p>Yes and no. Most of the entrepreneurs behind the companies I've
mentioned <em>are</em> open-source programmers, though I'd bet that they
currently don't get the chance to hack as much as they did in the past.
What you really want to know about is the guys actually pounding out the
code, right?</p>
<p>Companies such as RedHat routinely recruit open-source programmers to
enhance different aspects of Linux. Because these enhancements go back
into the pool of shared open-source code, the direct advantages RedHat
gets from them are short-lived. The indirect advantages derive from
participation in the larger market that the enhancements help to create.
RedHat and others seem to believe that these advantages outweigh the
costs.</p>
<p>O'Reilly funds open-source software and software documentation
efforts, and hires or contracts open-source software developers to serve
as writers and technical editors. Writing and publishing books of their
own is another source of income for open-source developers.</p>
<p>All of the companies mentioned above have technical positions staffed
with open-source programmers.</p>
<p>Not that open-source developers have much trouble landing programming
jobs. Having your name and e-mail address listed in the credits of the
Linux kernel, a hardware driver, or a file system implementation seems
to be a much better reference than a well prepared résumé -- you may
even skip the cover letter. The jobs that these programmers seek and get
are frequently compatible with their open-source work.</p>
<p>And don't rule out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/News/1999/19991012">private funding</a> as a source of
income. Who would <a class="reference external" href="http://www.redherring.com/insider/1999/0505/vc-linuxcare.html">give money</a>
to a bunch of hackers to pound out software that will ultimately be
available for free? The answer is companies that get more value out of
open source than what they invest in its sponsorship. One such case is
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> project, started and still
funded by a group of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The group wanted
an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective HTTP server whose development
they could at least partially control. Universities are also among the
institutions funding open source; it helps them reduce costs, and they
benefit academically as well.</p>
<p>Last but not least are the cooperative open-source initiatives like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sourcexchange.com/">sourceXchange</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cosource.com/">CoSource</a>. These start-ups call themselves
&quot;open-source marketplaces.&quot; They provide an online infrastructure to
connect open-source programmers with those interested in sponsoring
open-source projects. Any party -- company or programmer -- can either
propose an open-source project or sponsor one by committing a certain
amount of money. Programmers respond with proposals for the projects
they want to take. Ideally, the process will result in cooperative
funding for interesting projects and payment for programmers, all under
the constant supervision of the marketplace. All software produced goes
back to the shared pool as open source. It's a whole new way of software
contracting; we've yet to see were it will lead.</p>

<h2>Software: a service industry?</h2>
<p>It takes little research to discover that the question is not who's
making money from open source, but who isn't. With royalties out of the
question, those involved in open-source software have found innovative
ways of profiting, either by providing some sort of value-added services
or by making important savings based on open source. And new ways of
making business out of open source are being invented every day.
| Open-source evangelist <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/">Eric Raymond</a> -- who became well known for
his disclosure of Microsoft's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/">Halloween
documents</a>, and is now famous
for his analysis of open-source culture in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The* *Cathedral and The Bazaar</a> --
has written a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/writings/magic-cauldron/">new paper</a>
analyzing the economics of open-source software. In this paper Raymond
proposes that software is &quot;largely a service industry operating under
the persistent but unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing
industry,&quot; and that the &quot;use value&quot; of software far exceeds its &quot;sale
value,&quot; as evidenced by the large percentage of software created for
in-house use versus the very small percentage written to be sold as
merchandise.</p>
<p>Some of you may mistrust Raymond's views because he's patently within
the open-source
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/cb/chapter/magic-cauldron.html">inner-circle</a>.
Perhaps you'll find Steve Ballmer, president of Microsoft, more
convincing. &quot;Literally, if you go out seven to 10 years from now, not
only our business but every software business will have to remake itself
into what I call a software service company,&quot; Ballmer predicts in a
recent
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnnfn.com/1999/10/14/technology/wires/microsoft_wg/">interview</a>
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnnfn.com/">CNN Financial</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview Ballmer also mentions that Microsoft was
considering &quot;a modified form of open sourcing&quot; that would allow their
customers access to some code. This would let the customers &quot;try to
solve their own problems.&quot; (Not that Microsoft &quot;customers solving their
own problems&quot; is anything new.)</p>
<p>Is the move away from royalties and into value-added software services
something fueled by the open-source movement? Or does the so-called
friction-free economy of the Internet have anything to do with it? Will
the changes only affect programmers involved in commercial software, or
do corporate programmers also need to re-evaluate their situation?</p>
