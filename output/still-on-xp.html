<p>It's been a while since I last <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.neogeny.org/2009/05/back-to-xp.html">wrote about my
plan</a> to migrate
from Windows XP to Ubuntu Linux. The plan needed refining, and I needed
the time to proceed with the migration. What follows is the transcript
from my chalkboard with the current plan.</p>
<div class="section" id="repartitioning">
<h2>Repartitioning</h2>
<p>The backups and repartitioning were successfully done, and I have
read-only access to the remaining Windows partitions.</p>
<p>All of my files are still on the NTFS partitions, but they are well
backed up. I'll move them to the Ext3 partitions on a need basis.</p>
<p>I'm reminded that I need to write a Python script to catalogue my
backups. I didn't like any of the software out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="printing">
<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>It works, but the plan is to move the Epson three-in-one to a Windows
computer. I'll probably get a new printer that has Linux drivers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scanning">
<h2>Scanning</h2>
<p>I haven't made it work, , but the plan is to move the Epson
three-in-one to a Windows computer. Scanning is not a priority for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h2>Email</h2>
<p>Old email is well backed up. Recent email is also backed up by Google
Apps/Gmail. Two of the 12 accounts are not on Google Apps, but one of
them is switching, and the other one is well backed up by its
administrators.</p>
<p>As to clients, I'll have to learn to live with the GMail interface,
and handle the rest with Evolution. I still use my inbox as a task list
(even issues from the issue base land there), and</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contacts">
<h2>Contacts</h2>
<p>They were imported to GMail, and they can be exported from there to
VCard format, which almost any contacts software imports.</p>
<p>Just now I needed to find the license and code for Delphi 7, and it
was in my GMail contacts, as it was in MS Outlook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="calendar">
<h2>Calendar</h2>
<p>It was exported to Google Calendar, with which I can live with. I love
the email and SMS notifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web">
<h2>Web</h2>
<p>Firefox works great with every page I visit, thank you, and the
Chrome-like skins are fine. The fall-back to a Windows session is still
available in case of emergency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work">
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Assume the learning curve with Open Office. Any way, most of what I
write these days goes to the Web, a Wiki, or to a PDF.</p>
<p>For graphics, Inkscape seems to be all I need. I've never used
Photoshop, and there's Gimp in case I need to do manipulation of
graphics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="photography">
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>Picasa3 runs fine in Ubuntu 9.04/64. I don't need anything else
because I don't do much postprocessing these days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="music">
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Rythmbox Music Player plays my music fine (I don't care about the
files in Windows formats). There have been interruptions in the sound
every once in a while, but they may be bacause the music is still on one
of the NTFS partitions. The album artwork gets downloaded from I don't
know where. Searching works fine.</p>
<p>I still have to test burning a CD to listen to in the car.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skype">
<h2>Skype</h2>
<p>It works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teleconferencing">
<h2>Teleconferencing</h2>
<p>Ekiga works great since the admins opened up the SIP protocol route to
my moday telemeetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vpn">
<h2>VPN</h2>
<p>I haven't been able to make VPN to Windows servers work, but I do very
little work in those, and can fall back to a WinXP boot when I need to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programming">
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>Python, Java, C++, etc. are solved business with native installations
and Eclipse.</p>
<p>The only project that is tied to Windows is TRANUS. I'm testing how
things work over the virtualized XP today. Delphi7 works fine, and it
does so fast enough. I still need to test the Intel Fortran compiler.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Bluetooth is not working, which means that my favorite mouse isn't
working either. I'll either have to get a new mouse, or a new bluetooth
card/dongle.</p>
<p>My keyboard works fine, but it will get some time to get used to the
new US-International layout.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other">
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I expected Ubuntu 9.04/64 to be faster, but, by today's standards, my
Pentium D is an old machine with too little RAM.</p>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p>
