<p><em>So Microsoft is a monopolistic monster. What are you going to do,
gather the whole village to assault the castle with hoes and pitchforks?
Burn it down with torches? Get real.</em></p>
<p>James Whales' 1931 movie of Mary Shelley's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.filmsite.org/fran.html">Frankenstein</a> has become an
icon of horror cinematography. Fulfilling his personal vision, Dr.
Frankenstein creates a living man (or almost a man). Infusing life into
the inanimate, the doctor feels a God-like power. &quot;It's alive! Aliiive!&quot;
he screams, overwhelmed by the ecstasy that accompanies creation. But
Frankenstein's not-quite-human being is intelligent enough to claim a
larger space in the world than its maker imagined. The monster's power
makes everyone uncomfortable -- even its creator. Power frightens us
because the smallest actions of the powerful can have large
consequences, and their mistakes can be devastating. The mistakes of
Frankenstein's creature, though born of childlike naiveté, quickly
become too much to bear. As the film comes to an end, torch-wielding
villagers hunt down the monster. The mob sets fire to an old mill where
the creature is trapped, and there it presumably dies.</p>
<div class="section" id="conflicting-viewpoints">
<h2>Conflicting viewpoints</h2>
<p><img alt="frankestein" src="/images/B00000JMOF.01.MZZZZZZZ.gif" /></p>
<p>Frankenstein and his creation come to mind when I contemplate
developers' reactions to Judge Jackson's findings of fact in the
Microsoft-DOJ antitrust case. Having found Microsoft to be a monopoly (a
kind of monster), the mob has been quick to loudly indict: <em>Tear it to
pieces! Restrain it permanently! Confine it! Destroy it!</em></p>
<p>Voices of reason have also spoken. In his 11 Nov. <em>Developer News</em>
<a class="reference external" href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,20063,00.html">article</a>,
correspondent Jeff Russell maintains that the case brought against
Microsoft holds little water, and that the allegations brought against
the company would have been better dealt with in civil court, if at all.
Long-term <a class="reference external" href="http://www.byte.com/">Byte</a> columnist Jerry Pournelle
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.byte.com/printableArticle?doc_id=BYT19991108S0001">explains</a>
why Microsoft's success should be credited mostly to its acting smarter
and doing things better than its competitors, rather than to excess of
power. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/">PC Week</a> columnist Peter
Coffee
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.zdnet.com/filters/printerfriendly/0,6061,1018027-2,00.html">says</a>,
&quot;The judge just didn't get it.&quot;</p>
<p>Judging from the results of polls like the one at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vote.com/vResults/index.phtml?voteID=237932">vote.com</a>,
and from most of the &quot;talkback&quot; messages posted in reply to the past two
weeks' news, it would seem that Microsoft never did anything wrong -- or
that whatever it did, government intervention isn't merited.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might base your opinion on the anti-Microsoft
sentiment that has sparked and grown in the past 10 years. How did the
company start getting nicknames like &quot;Microslop&quot; and &quot;M$&quot; in developer
circles?</p>
<p>So Microsoft is a monster. What does one do with a monster? What is
the reasonable response? How should the company itself view its actions?
What is the role of the development community? What does the whole issue
seem to predict for the future? Obviously, such questions can't even be
considered from the perspective of an angry, frightened mob.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-monster-s-blunders">
<h2>The monster's blunders</h2>
<p>It takes no more than a quick scan of the Web to gather a list of
allegations against Microsoft. Consumer advocates Ralph Nader and James
Love have compiled a series of documents related to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.essential.org/antitrust/microsoft/">Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct</a>.
The Web also provides many links to the proceedings of trials brought against
Microsoft for anticompetitive behavior; those brought by
<a class="reference external" href="http://java.sun.com/lawsuit/82198unfair.html">Sun</a> and by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.calderathin.com/fullstory/vaporwre.html">Caldera</a> are
two. Microsoft is cited in examples of anticompetitive practices in a
couple of university courses on <a class="reference external" href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/CSC379/lectures/Lecture_15.html">ethics and
computing</a>.
According to these and other articles, documents, Web pages, and online
discussions, Microsoft has indulged in such nefarious practices as:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.csn.net/%7Ebediger/nt.sekrits.html">hiding</a> and using to
its advantage the undocumented, simpler, and more efficient native
system API in Windows NT; preannouncing nonexistent products to
discourage consumer purchases of rival goods
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.calderathin.com/fullstory/vaporwre.html">vaporware</a>);
avoiding or
<a class="reference external" href="http://java.sun.com/lawsuit/82198unfair.html">sabotaging</a> open and
semi-open standards; creating <a class="reference external" href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,10468,00.html">DLL
Hell</a>;
delivering <a class="reference external" href="http://kerkis.math.aegean.gr/%7Edspin/pubs/jrnl/1997-CSI-WinApi/html/win.html">badly designed
software</a>;
and much more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dr-frankenstein-s-dues">
<h2>Dr. Frankenstein's dues</h2>
<p>In his article
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.around.com/microsoft.html">Making Microsoft safe for capitalism</a>,&quot;
journalist James Gleick interviews several industry leaders about their opinions on
Microsoft. Among those queried is Mitchell Kapor, who was founder and
CEO of Lotus Development Corp., the company that produced the
best-selling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application. According to the
article, Kapor thinks Microsoft has &quot;thin ethics.&quot; Kapor says:</p>
<blockquote>
Anything not a direct lie or clearly illegal is OK to do and should
be done if it advances Microsoft's tribal cause. This licenses the
worst sorts of manipulations, lies, tortured self-justifications,
and so on.</blockquote>
<p>Yet in the same article, Gleick suggests that it is not the company's
practices that have sparked the anti-Microsoft sentiment, but the
perpetrator itself:</p>
<blockquote>
Microsoft is hardly alone, of course; plenty of its competitors
would play as rough, if they only could. Others in the industry
suggest that Microsoft's small-company scrappiness has kept it from
facing the issue of corporate ethics. Behavior that people will
forgive, or at least understand, in a start-up looks considerably
less attractive when David grows into Goliath.</blockquote>
<p>It's not only what the monster does that incites us; it's what the
monster is. But can we really expect integrity from a monster? Monster
authority Joe Sena, Deaditor-In-Grief of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.horroronline.com/">Universal's Online Horror
Channel</a>, writes in his June 1998
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.universalstudios.com/horror/june98/deaditorial.html">deaditorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Just what kind of vows do [monsters] take, anyway -- &quot;Until
dissection or torch-wielding mob do we [sic] part&quot;? Or do sequels
render such finality moot?</blockquote>
<p>Should monsters be accountable for what monsters do? Sure. But
shouldn't their creators accept part of the blame? &quot;Let's go after Bill
Gates!&quot; Many would rally to the cry. But what about all the managers
who've said, &quot;You can't go wrong choosing Microsoft&quot;? Or the programmers
who've rationalized, &quot;Clients want VB (VC++, MFC, COM), so that's what I
give them&quot;? What about the unimaginative computing companies and their
&quot;do-what-Microsoft-does&quot; ways? What about the millions of users
protesting, &quot;But my friend can't read my documents if they're not from
Microsoft Word&quot;? It's a monster all right, but we have all helped create
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-face-in-the-mirror">
<h2>The face in the mirror</h2>
<p>According to the script, this is the point where I declare the
verdict. What penalty do I think the court should impose against
Microsoft's recurrent abuses? No penalty. Nothing at all. Leave
Microsoft alone. <em>Ignore it.</em> Microsoft succeeded in an industry that
has been continuously inventing itself for the past 20 years. It
succeeded where better-established companies that had started on a
better footing fared worse, or even failed. What good is a computer on
every desk if people can't exchange letters and spreadsheets? In a world
begging for data and usability standards, Microsoft provided them: its
own. After all, as far as standards are concerned, there can be only
one.</p>
<p>For the U.S. government to act against Microsoft in court would be
like taking the guillotine to our own creation. It would be too much,
too late. The computing world in which Microsoft was nourished (on which
it fed?) no longer exists. Along with the ubiquitous and global Internet
have come new ways of setting standards. These days, more than market
power is needed to influence the Internet's evolution. The
fastest-growing area of computing is that of interconnected, wireless
appliances and wearable devices. Microsoft has a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.3com.com/news/releases/pr99/oct1399a.html">long</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.allnetdevices.com/news/9911/991115palm/991115palm.html">long</a>
way to go before its presence is felt there. Then there's the open
source movement. Microsoft has yet to demonstrate that it can negotiate
the <a class="reference external" href="http://community.borland.com/devnews/article/1,1714,10550,00.html">rapid
transition</a>
from software royalties into services. And we've yet to see how
Microsoft and the users of its products will fare once the new year
arrives.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: We shouldn't be scared of monsters anymore. If
you're still concerned about Microsoft's power, there are things you can
do. For your next project, why not base your choice of development
environment on merits, rather than on market share? Why not get hold of
a Linux distribution and learn to use it? How about learning to program
on it? How about supporting more portable and open programming languages
like Python, Perl, and Java? How about choosing something different from
Windows to run the gadget you're giving yourself for Christmas? As we
often tell our kids: just ignore the monster, and it will go away.</p>
