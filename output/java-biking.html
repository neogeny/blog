<p><em>Launching a full-blown IDE for a brief Java programming excursion can
be like driving the car to a nearby shopping mall. If you have ever
imagined the equivalent of a Java bicycle, your fantasy may have come
true with BeanShell v. 1.0.</em></p>
<p>I'd just moved to Davis, California, and it was the first time I'd
gone shopping. I parked my bicycle in an empty rack, dashed in, grabbed
the few things I needed, and found a checkout register.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pehperohplahstig.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The salute was unexpected, and the tinny accent of the
northern-California girl didn't help.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Paper-or-plastic?&quot;</blockquote>
<p>she repeated, more slowly this time. But it wasn't
until the third time that I understood.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Oh! Paper bags will be OK, Thanks!&quot;</blockquote>
<p>The reply, &quot;You bet!&quot;, was another surprise, but I didn't ask for
translation. I paid, gathered my stuff, and hurried out, glad I could
cycle home quickly with my groceries.</p>
<p>As a young programmer, I was always in a hurry, and if there's a
heaven for bikers, it is the little town of Davis. My apartment was well
within walking distance of the shopping mall, but I preferred to ride.
It took only a few minutes to reach the mall by bike, most of them spent
waiting at the Russell Avenue crossing. Driving would have been overkill
for such a short trip -- especially considering the effects on the ozone
layer -- and probably the most time-consuming of the options.</p>
<p>I've often felt that launching a full-blown development environment
for a brief <a class="reference external" href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> programming excursion is
like taking the car out to go to the nearby mall. Yet going about with
just a text editor and the command line compiler seems too cumbersome,
too much like going on foot -- especially if the task at hand is not
trivial, or if it's one of those days when one out of ten key-presses is
a typing error. The solution I've imagined would be something equivalent
to a Java programming bicycle.</p>
<p>I went Web-spelunking and found a beta version of what promised to be
the ideal solution to my short programming excursion needs -- someday.
Then, just a couple of weeks ago, I was notified by e-mail that
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell 1.0</a> was available. I decided
to take the tool for a ride.</p>

<div class="section" id="beanshell-1-0">
<h2>BeanShell 1.0</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell</a> is a small interpreter
written in Java by <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pat&#64;pat.net">Pat Niemeyer</a>. It executes
standard Java statements and expressions in addition to several
scripting commands. The tool supports scripted objects as simple method
closures like those in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and JavaScript.
BeanShell is open source and free to use under the terms of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</a>.</p>
<p>BeanShell comes with both GUI (Swing) and console mode interpreters.
The GUI interpreter provides command history recall, command line
editing, cut and paste, support for multiple sessions, and a simple
editor for scripts.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="/images/beanshot.jpg" /></p>
<p>The language
interpreted by BeanShell is very similar to JavaScript. There's no need
to declare variables or parameter types; the tool does type checking at
runtime. Any class, object, or method available to the Java interpreter
can be accessed from within BeanShell using standard Java syntax. The
interpreter understands Java import statements, and it provides a
convenient syntax for accessing Java Bean properties. External commands
can be invoked from within the interpreter using the exec command, so
you can also access other tools, like your favorite editor or the Java
compiler, from within the shell. Several other useful commands and
variables -- such as dir, print, and cwd -- are provided by default, and
the built-in command set can be readily extended using either BeanShell
scripts or Java.</p>
<p>BeanShell can also be embedded into your applications to provide them
with scripting functionality. The core interpreter, with all console
functionality removed, fits in a 135K Jar file. The tool also provides a
&quot;server mode,&quot; which allows for remote access to the interpreter using
HTTP. Upon gaining access to the specified TCP port, BeanShell will send
back a remote console applet that can be used to query or change the
state of the running application in which BeanShell is embedded. It's
also possible to talk to the interpreter in terminal mode by using the
Telnet protocol.</p>
<p>The documentation, which is available from the BeanShell Web site,
includes the script language's syntax, the built-in commands, and
instructions for installing, running, and embedding the tool. A set of
JavaDoc pages covers the product's internal API. There is a mailing list
for BeanShell users and developers on the site as well.</p>
<p>With BeanShell at hand I can easily experiment with libraries and
classes I develop or download from the Internet without recompiling, and
without bothering to set up a new project in the IDE. As it turns out,
my Java bike was not just a fantasy after all.</p>
