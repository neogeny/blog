Since the early days of software development we learned that there
were some forces that were determinant for a project's success. We
identified the triangle of scope, time, and resources (effort), and used
to say to our users: "pick two".

Soon afterwards we understood that those three dimensions were not
enough when we found that we could build software that met its scope,
was done in time, and reasonably within the estimated effort, but was
unusable because it was ridden with bugs and had an unbearable user
interface. So we added a fourth dimension to the forces that drive
software projects: quality. The typical depiction is a thetraedron
because in it every vertex is conected to the other three, but a fully
connected graph drawn as a asquare would fit the same purpose. We told
our users and customers "pick three", and went on, failing to keep our
commitments in about half of all software projects.

What we have found after a couple of decades is twofold. First, that it
is never a matter of picking the constraints but of balancing them;
*agile* development, for example, aims for a balance that delivers value
earlier, even if it means a longer project and more effort in the end.
Second, we found that the four dimensions were not enough, and that we
needed to consider two additional dimensions to have a project that
converges to closure: architectural design, and project design.

The issue is that it is not possible to build any moderately complex
piece of software any way you want. The "best design" may be the one
that dooms a project to failure, and a typical per-module process may
make a project never ending. Both software design and project design
must be flexible and thought out as to accomodate and balance the other
forces. The *what*\ and the *how* must be included in the plan. A
time-critical project and a quality-critical (or resource-bound)
project are totally different beasts, and they must be designed and
executed differently.

An example. We all know what an automobile must do functionally, and how
much it should cost, more or less. But there are infinite designs to
meet the basic requirements, and many strategies to build those designs.
Only some of them will be sucessful.

The new criteria add up to the forces that interact and must be balanced
to have a succesful software project. They are now: scope, time,
resources, architecture, and process. A fully connected exagonical
graph.
