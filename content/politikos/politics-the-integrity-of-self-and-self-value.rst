Politics isn't inherently evil. It's inherently evil only with the
connotations we tend to associate with politics. That is, manipulative,
selfish, one-sided, etc. But being manipulative isn't necessarily evil,
and "selfish" is one of those words I have a philosophical problem with.
I'm an Objectivist, so "selfish" has a specific meaning to me and I
consider it a virtue. I'll get back to this in a minute.

Politics and honor aren't mutually exclusive if you consider them
essentially the same thing. I know that sounds bizarre, but it really
isn't. Politics, in its most basic sense, is a system of cooperation
between individuals in order to achieve specific goals. So is honor,
really. They are both something like manners. Polite politics. IMO, this
is pretty clear so far. Here's where we trip: being nice.

Honesty is considered a virtue, but there's an exception for
being"nice" that's called a white lie. White lies are supposed to be
gloss, a small dishonesty for the sake of being nice. For the sake of
being polite. For the sake of being political.

No, dear. That dress doesn't make you look fat.

Yes, honey. That dress emphasizes your ass, which seems to be carrying
most of your extra weight, even though you are only 10 lbs. heavier than
you should be, and your stomach is slightly more convex than it should
be.

The question itself is a wash under normal protocols, even if you're
the sort of man who prefers women heavier or proportioned differently
than models and stars. But the question asked wasn't about your
preferences, or even about your subjective truth; it's reflective of
herself-perception. You're being asked to be supportive, not to be
clinically accurate. Since the filter is hers and not yours, there isno
moral imperative to the question. You're free to tell her that you don't
like red or that you don't like the style, or you can tell her that
you're looking forward to removing it, or some variant of those answers.

That classic trap isn't actually a trap if you're with someone you
love and value, and if you can realize which set of filters is being
used. Maybe that seems like I've just played 3 card monte with the
truth, but in fact I haven't. I just recognized that men ask literal
questions and demand literal answers, whereas women ask metaphorical
questions and require metaphorical answers. That isn't to say that a
woman won't sandbag you with a serious, literal question at the worst
possible moment, because they sure as hell will, but that isn't the
point.

As for other situations where being "nice" or not is the moral
equivalent of committing suicide, the idea is to avoid being around
those kind of people. Or in establishing a relationship with them in
away that allows you to be honest instead of completely "nice"
where"nice" is equal to lying against a situation of blackmail or
another form of coercion.

Force and value are what I look at. Is being nice a result of some
sort of force? IOW, if I don't tell the boss he's smart, am I going to
get fired?

My value to myself is paramount. And I'm "selfish" about it. Selfish,
to me, means that I have an obligation to consider my profit over the
long term. Both my honor and my value require that in considering
myself-interests, I actively look to enhance the self-interests of
othersalso. It isn't unusual for me to initiate a transaction where I
profit only a little or not at all (although I don't lose by it), where
others may profit quite a lot. This is honor, politics, self-interest,
and selfishness all at once. I advance my friends, and they will
remember it. Even if they don't, everyone else will. That's good
politics, although it's no less manipulative than the other kind. The
difference is that friendship actually assumes that sort of
manipulation. Not "for their own good" where your judgment supercedes
theirs (which is always bad, even if you're right), but where your
judgment and theirs agree.

I flatly don't get into situations where I have to tell someone that
they're smarter than they are, or whatever, because the situation itself
is against my self-interests and dishonorable from the start.
You/cannot/ win in such a situation. All you can do is fight fires, and
you're going to get burned in the process no matter what you do. It's
the nature of dishonorable situations.

What I essentially do is make myself respectable. I try to earn
respect, on my terms, in a consistent manner, by behaving in a way that
I respect. Those people I'd prefer to associate with will consider my
behavior attractive, establishing the first link necessary to being able
to work with them. That doesn't mean we will always see eye-to-eye, but
it does mean that I'll operate at a level where like-minded people are
attracted to me. And I'll manipulate it, always to mutual gain viewed
over the long term. I'll also actively feed you what's necessary for you
to manipulate me and my self-interests along the same lines. The basis
for true friendship is a mutual bootstrap process.

Trust is always the most basic element of a relationship, but true
trust is unlikely. Trust isn't, "I trust you" and you presenting a
vulnerability. That's an abstract that rarely applies. Self-interest,
OTOH, can define trust objectively. If you give me $50K, where is
myself-interest? To take the money and run? That's the usual answer.
After all, whatever deal we have that may have motivated the transaction
could fail and I'd lose the $50K plus whatever benefit could have come
from it. This is short-term bullshit. It's lack of thought, among other
things. For self-interest to be involved, I'd want you to succeed, even
if you succeed more than I do. If you succeed, I'ma resource. If you're
smart, you'll want your resources to be valuable in themselves so you
can consistently use the bootstrap process, always at an increasingly
higher level.

Politics is establishing your value to others. Self-interest is
establishing your value to your yourself. Honor is the bridge between
the two. If I've been fairly clear, you should understand when I say
that "give until it hurts" is one of the foulest things someone can say.

That concept isolates people, and the only thing it gives back is an
equal amount of pain. Giving someone $50K really isn't a nice thing to
do. It hurts you and it leaves them stuck with only $50K. But if two
heads are better than one, then so is mutual profit better than single
profit. You may have divided the profit, but you've gained an additional
resource, and that resource is going to think along lines you don't,
covering more bases, giving you more options, expanding your
capabilities. Also, that divided profit really isn't divided, because
the profit can be combined again for more profit. The fact that you
aren't the only one profiting is actually ultimately more valuable to
you because others will see it and want in, which gives you an ability
to magnify profit that you couldn't do if you only profit. Less is more,
because less leads to more.

It all starts with your ability to assert your value. It then follows
that you attain a following of people with a high value who believe in
your value. You then leverage their value along with your own, creating
even more value. When I say "profit", I don't necessarily mean money,
but it doesn't matter. No matter how you work this, if you do it right
you will always end up with more money along the way. It builds up the
same way stalagmites do, steady accretion.

For this sort of thing to work, you have to be honest. You have to
establish your self-interests and promote them actively. You have to
broadcast what you're doing. And most people won't believe you. It
doesn't matter. Eventually the results start kicking in, and then it
snowballs.

People will tell you that giving a bum $5 is nice and the good thing
to do. It isn't. If you really want to be nice and compassionate, you'll
keep your money. It squeezes the bum and forces him to do something
other than subsist on others' misunderstanding of generosity. OTOH, it's
worthwhile to invest in children. Not to promote an expectation of
receiving without merit, but to promote the idea that generosity can be
socially profitable and personally profitable. It doesn't matter if
someone else sees you being generous to a child. The idea is that the
child understands it. Leave a sea of grateful children behind you.
Ignore the adults.

Playing stupid games may make you a rich SOB, but playing to
yourself-interest will make you an honorable rich man.
