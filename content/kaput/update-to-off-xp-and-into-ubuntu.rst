I decided to install the Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) beta, and crashed
the machine due to my impatience. After a reinstall of 9.04, the upgrade
to 9.10 went well. It took only a few hours (a similar attempt with
Windows would have taken days).

Now the update:

Bluetooth
---------

It works, both with my favorite mouse (what will I do with the new one I
bought?), and with my cell phone.

VPN
---

PPTP to Windows servers works if the configuration is set up right, both
in Ubuntu Jaunty and in Karmic (I should write a post about how I got it
working).
