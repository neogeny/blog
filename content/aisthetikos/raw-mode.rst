*The less, the better*

According to
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW_image_format>`__:

    A **raw image file** contains minimally processed data from the
    image sensor of a digital camera or image scanner. Raw files are so
    named because they are not yet processed and ready to use by a
    bitmap graphics editor, printed, or displayed by a typical web
    browser. The image must be processed and converted to an RGB format
    such as
    `TIFF <http://www.neogeny.org/blog/addStaticPage.secureaction?name=TIFF>`__\ :sup:`?`
    or
    `JPEG <http://www.neogeny.org/blog/addStaticPage.secureaction?name=JPEG>`__\ :sup:`?`
    before it can be manipulated.

Actually, today many image browsers and editors are able to process the
*RAW* image formats of leading camera vendors.

-  Microsoft's *`"RAW Image Thumbnailer and Viewer for Windows
   XP" <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d48e808e-b10d-4ce4-a141-5866fd4a3286>`__*
   allows you to view thumbnails and use the *Picture Viewer*
   application over *RAW* files.
-  Google's *`Picasa <http://picasa.google.com/>`__* now supports
   various *RAW* image formats, from indexing to editing.
-  Adobe's
   *`Lightroom <http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/>`__*
   project will provide professional-quality cataloguing and editing for
   images in *RAW* format.
-  The latest versions of the software that comes bundled with digital
   cameras allows for basic editing of *RAW* images. Such is the case
   with `my
   camera <http://www.neogeny.org/blog/addStaticPage.secureaction?name=my%20camera>`__\ :sup:`?`.

As I see it, the digital *RAW* is the equivalent of the film negative,
and there's no way to go if you're serious about your photography than
to shoot and transfer your pictures in *RAW* format.
