| When in doubt, seek Honey
| Honey's always home
| If you meet The Wicked Witch of West
| Just click your heels times three
| Don't mind the shoes you're wearing
| 'Cause home ain't where you are
| It's where you want to be
| When The Red Queen of Hearts is near
| Paint a white rose red, and see
| You'll be judged anyway
| And it would be Off with your head
| If there wasn't always time for tea
| At other times, just Chant this Spell
| Dear Fear, I must leave you now
| Come find it, and you won't
| For Fear lives far from home

    *for Tom, who sometimes forgets where his Honey is.*
