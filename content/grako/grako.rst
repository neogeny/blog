`Grako <https://bitbucket.org/apalala/grako/>`__ is feature complete,
and I'm already using it for the project that required it. The parser
generated by **Grako** for
my \ `COBOL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol>`__ grammar is already
parsing a couple of hundred thousand lines of code, with failures so far
attributable to the grammar, and not the tool

I won't bless **Grako** with a 1.0rc1 tag until someone (different
from me) has tried it, but I'm confident about how the tool is working
now.

The motivations for this endeavour are explained on `my previous
post <http://blog.neogeny.org/2013/01/grako_9.html>`__ and on project's
`README <https://bitbucket.org/apalala/grako/>`__.

I took exactly 29 days to complete the project.

Thank's to Tom Bragg for trusting, and funding!
