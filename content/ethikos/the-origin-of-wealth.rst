The `wonderful book`_ by Eric D. Beinhocker reccounts how classic
economic theories were formed and transformed during the past few
centuries, and why those theories fail when confronted with economic
reality. It then goes on to propose a new view of economics approaching
it from the perspective of
`evolution theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution>`__, the
`laws of thermodynamics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics>`__
(which were unknown at the time classic theories had their origin), and
common sense.\ `

The result, as the author himself notes, does not answer every
question about economics, yet it explains in a thoughtful and enjoyable
way how classic theories fail because of their fundamental flaws, why a
new approach to economics is needed, and what common sense, research,
and reality indicate the new approach should be.

Highly recommended.
