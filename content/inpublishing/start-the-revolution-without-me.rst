*Confused by the ruckus over open-source software? Bobby McFerrin had
it right: Don't worry, keep hacking.*

Everybody's talking about the "open software revolution." From geek
forums like SlashDot to academic journals like *Communications of the
ACM,* from the *New York Times* to *The Wall Street Journal,* everyone
is saying that there's something important going on.

The leaders of the open-source movement argue that their way of doing
things will change the world of software development forever. Detractors
question their leadership and attack their ideas on business, logical,
economic, political, sociological, and other grounds. The hubbub is
rising so fast I've seen good friends worry that open-source software
may destroy their way of life by making it impossible to sell software
or write it for hire.

I'm not at home with the rhetoric of any of the factions. I'm not a
radical, I'm a programmer. You say you want a revolution? You can count
me out.

War of the words
----------------

Like many programmers, I have used and written open-source software
for a long time. I'm glad that we now have a phrase -- *open source -*-
to describe what we've been doing. But I object to narrow definitions
that exclude workable, time-honored, and popular practices. Now that we
have a buzzword, people are trying to cram political and economic
agendas into the term.

There are those, for instance, who argue that open-source development
is the solution to all software development problems. But they do so
based on information drawn from just a few successful projects. Most of
the open-source projects I have tracked over the past 18 months have
been cancelled, only to become data points that feed the well-known
statistics about the high failure rate of software projects.
Methodologies are a dozen for a penny; these projects failed because
they never had a feasible business plan.

In the opposite corner are those who see the open-source movement as a
threat to the software industry. Never mind that open-source initiatives
are law-abiding and -- because of their open nature -- much less likely
to fall into the anticompetitive practices that characterize a part of
our industry. Never mind that thousands of developers are gainfully
employed on open-source projects. Never mind that hundreds of thousands
of users entrust their businesses to their work. They are convinced that
the sky is falling.

Then there's the debate over "free" software.

On one side are the developers and activists who believe software
should not be treated as intellectual property. Or that it should be
treated like intellectual property, but developers should waive their
property rights.

On the other side are people who oppose free software. Some because
they think it's impractical, and some because the initiative seems
politically suspect -- too leftish. The extreme left has become
extremely unpopular in most circles, and all of this talk of free
software smacks of outmoded socialist ideas. As long as those
impressions persist, I don't see how the free software cause can make it
to a critical mass of supporters.

Intellectual property has been a hairy issue since the invention of
speech at least, and intense debates about it precede the Internet era
by centuries. The debates are so intense, you have to wonder how any
country's founding fathers were able to quiet the ruckus long enough to
slip intellectual-property language into their constitutions.

The shouting's so loud, it's tempting to ignore the arguments. But you
can't simply ignore the "free" versus "proprietary" software debate --
no more than you would ignore debates between Republicans and Democrats
in the U.S. or Greens and Social Democrats in Germany. This debate is
truly about ideas. It's worthy of your attention.

It is difficult to write about these issues without making a
contribution to the arguments. But I'm determined: I'm not about to take
a side on these issues. I do think that open-source development will
impact software development in general, and in an important way. But I
think that the effect won't be immediate, and it won't be obvious. To
know what this "revolution" will actually lead to...well, you have to
wait. My take is that the factions will ultimately reconcile.

Strip away the rhetoric and it's clear: There is no revolution. The
ideas being argued and shouted are interesting, and important, yes, but
their effect will be evolutionary. Like always.

So don't worry. It will be all right.
