This recipe was originally written for the first edition of the recipe
book by parents, teachers, and students of the Eduplin Preschool.

*These days Italians frequently use the word "pasticcio" to describe
complicated stuff, much like Venezuelans would use "pastel" (pie). It is
because, in all its forms, the pasticcio is a concoction of tomatos,
meat, and pasta, baked in the oven like a pie.*

*Different forms of pasticcio have been prepared for centuries in the
populations that border the Mediterranean Sea, with each region having
its own version. The original recipes come from Grece and South Italy,
and they consist of actual pies with crusts made of wheat filled with a
ragú. Venezuelans are used to call "pasticcio" to the creamy and compact
preparation served in many Italian restaurantes, but that, because of
its characteristics, should be called "Lassagna alla Romana".*

*This dish is not a real pasticcio either, but it is much more like it
than the Lasagna alla Romana, it's easier to make, and it's the one we
like at home. It doesn't have cream, the souce is of tomatoes with meat
instead of meat with tomatoes, and it has a very Mediterranean flavor.
In contrast with the typical Caracas pasticcio, this one has an intense
flavor, which makes it easy to accompany with other dishes, and it
tastes very well after refrigerated and reheated.*

Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Tomatoes**
   Four to seis ripe, plum tomatoes per person. If canned, add one
   shredded carrot per pound of tomatoes to compensate for the acidity
   (onions work too).
-  **Garlic**
   One clove per person.
-  **Black Olives**
   Four to six per person. Greek ones have a nice flavor.
-  **Anchovees**
   One to two filets per person. Use the bownless and pink ones.
-  **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**
   It is used generously, so have available at least half a cup for
   every two pounds of tomatoes.
-  **Perled Ground Beef**
   70 to 120 grams per person. Choose a cut with some grease and
   have it ground coarsely in front of you. Packaged ground beef is not
   as good.

-  **Ground Parmiggiano or Peccorino Cheese**
   About 50 grams per person.**
-  **Fresh Basil**
   cut in small strips.
-  **Fresh Orégano Leaves**
-  **Pasta**
   100 to 150 grams per person, depending on how hungry people are,
   and on other dishes. We use lasagna, but short pasta (penne,
   rigatonni, fussili) works great.
-  **Salt and Pepper**
-  **Variations**
   You can add other herbs like salvia, bay leafs, or thyme, to
   taste. You can also add a couple of strips of bacon per person, or an
   equivalent amount of pork to the meat.


The Sauce
~~~~~~~~~

Preparation tine for the sauce is proportional to the amount of
tomatoes: aproximately half an hour, plus an addtional half hour for
each four persons. The sauce takes time to thicken to the right point,
but the work is very little. The sauce can be made in advance and
refrigerated.

Cot the tomatoes in half and then in thin slices (if they are canned,
squash them with your hands, keeping the liquid). Peel and cut the
garlik in thin slices. Cut the anchovee filets coarsely. Pit the olives
and cut them in slices.

Use a pan with enough size to hold all the tomatoes. Add enough olive
oil to cover the bottom, and heat to low heat. Add the garlic and cook
until it starts changing color (if that seems to be happening too fast,
lower the heat!). And the anchovees and the olives, raise the heat a
bit, and cook for a few minutes, until the anchovees and olives start to
dehydrate (this step is to make the ingredients transfer their flavor to
the oil).

Add the tomatoes and raise the heat to medium-high. Add some salt, and
cook the tomatoes until they start to come a part and you begin to get a
sauce. Lower the heat so the sauce doesn't sprinkle out of the pan (if
you cover the pan, the cooking will take longer). If you used canned
tomatoes, add the shredded carrots at this point.

Stir the sauce frequently with a wooden spoon so it doesn't stick to
the bottom. Add olive oil during the cooking until the sauce has a
brilliant, yummy color, and stops sticking to the bottom of the pan. The
sauce is ready when it's thick enough to let you see the bottom of the
pan when you run a wooden spoon accross it. The sauce, when ready, must
be slightly oily.


The Meat
~~~~~~~~

Season the ground meat to taste with salt, pepper, a good amount of
basil, and other spices you like (I've used cinamon, cloves, paprika,..
at times).

Place a small amount of olive oil on a pan, and let it heat on high. Add
the meat when the oil is hot. Stir constantly until the meat starts to
brown. Remove the meat from the heat and add it to the tomato sauce.
Place the pan in the stove again, recover the juices with wine, broth,
or water, and add them to the sauce. Cook the tomato sauce until it
thickens again.

Adjust the flavor of the sauce with salt and fresh pepper. Add, to
taste, abundant basil and oregano.

The Pasta
~~~~~~~~~

When you're ready to make the pasticcio, cook the pasta in abundant,
salty water. Remove the pasta from the water before it is done, and cool
it with running water to stop the cooking.

The Pasticcio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need enough medium-depth baking pans to hold the pasticcio. As
an idea, a 16"x10"x3" pan is good for about eight people. The pans can
be any shape.

Place a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Then,
susecively, add thin layers of pasta, sauce, and chesse, sprinkling with
some basil each time. Repeat until the pan is full, adding some extra
cheese to the last layer. If you're using lasagna, cut the pieces with
your hands so they don't align from layer to layer, and they cover well
the borthers of whatever shape of pan you're using; that will give
structure to the pasticcio, and prevent it from cooking too much on the
borders.

To serve, heat the pasticcion in an oven at 220 C (450F) until the
cheese in the top layer starts to melt and brown (use less temperature
when reheating it). Serve immediately.

You can accompany the pasticcio with a salad of dark green leaves, and
a good red wine.
