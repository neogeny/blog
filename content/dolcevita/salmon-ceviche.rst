This is a delicious way to prepare fresh salmon. The recipe has
nuances that stimulate almost every taste receptor in your body.

Ingredients for four people
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Four fillets of skinless, boneless, and very fresh (non-smoked)
   salmon cut into byte-sized chunks
-  A red onion, sliced or chopped
-  About four spoonfulls of finely sliced red, sweet (non hot) chilies.
-  A spoonfull of freshly cut cylantro
-  About twenty small capers
-  One tangerine (mandarin), peeled, and white parts removed
-  The juice of two tangerines
-  Half a cup of fresh lemon juice
-  One hot, yellow chili, or yellow chili hot sauce or any other mildly
   hot chili or chili sauce
-  Salt and peper


For the garnish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Four medium-sized sweet potatoes, peeled, cut in thick slices, and
   blanched
-  Corn off the cobb, either blanched or sauteed in butter until it's
   tender (Peruvians use the kind of corn with the giant grains)


Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mix the fish and all the dry ingredients in a bowl, cover, and let stand
in the fridge for half an hour or more.

When you're ready to serve, cut the tangerine in byte-sized pieces, and
add to the salmon along with the tangerine juice.

Slowly add the lemon juice until the acidity seems right.

Add salt and peper to taste.

Serve within a few minutes along with the sweet potatoes and corn as
garnish, or wait some more for the fish to "cook" in the acid if your
guests have a "thing" with raw fish. Serving it immediately is best.


How Spicy?
~~~~~~~~~~

It is important that the Ceviche is hot. You can either add the hot
chili cut in large pieces (so people don't confuse it with the sweet
one) to the bowl, or you can serve the ceviche along with hot chilli
sauce and let everyone add heat to their plate as they wish.

You can buy the yellow chili hot sauce from a specialized food store, or
you can prepare it your self on the blender out of fresh chillis or
chilli powder, adding a little water, oil, vinegar, and salt.

The sweet potatoes and the (also sweet) corn serve to wash out the heat
between ceviche bytes.
