<p><em>What &quot;revolution&quot;? A long-term open source enthusiast describes his
conversion.</em></p>
<p>Source code has been available for decades, long before the so-called
&quot;open source revolution&quot; started. I have found value in using and
writing open source software since I first began experimenting with open
source solutions to critical business problems. It's easy to become
paranoid about backups after the first important loss of work to a
system failure. For me it happened while in college, and I flunked the
project. The next stage of paranoia comes when one groks that the
precious latest backups will frequently have a much lesser value than
the backups of previous working versions. Such a revelation will
motivate most programmers to implement some sort of version control and
backup strategy. At the next stage, one realizes that the contents of
the version control database are the real source, and that what any
given source directory contains is just a partial image of the whole
thing.</p>
<p>My early primitive attempts at version control (file renaming,
directory cloning) eventually led to the installation of a commercial
version control package: Microsoft Delta. Delta was not an ambitious
package. It lacked many features that other packages advertised, and its
documentation was lacking in many places. But I had received my copy for
free by raving about Microsoft in a local newspaper, so I decided to
give it a shot. Delta served my version control needs flawlessly for
years until, unexpectedly, Microsoft decided to drop the software.</p>
<p>&quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought. &quot;The software works fine, so why not
continue to use it unsupported?&quot; But 1995 arrived, and with it Windows
95. Delta simply would not cooperate with the new 32-bit OS. As the
product had been discontinued, the only support option provided was a
free upgrade to SourceSafe, which Microsoft had recently acquired. My
initial evaluation of SourceSafe left me wary of a version control
system that would store my source code in an undocumented, proprietary
binary format. I queried the Net (CompuServe at that time) and found out
about the many problems people were having with SourceSafe. I decided to
pass on this system and evaluate other commercial options.</p>
<p>Good version control comes third in a software developer's toolbox
only because a compiler that produces correct output, and libraries that
do what they should, are things one simply can't live without. After
ruling out SourceSafe, I bought and evaluated the two most recognized
and touted version control packages under US$1000. To my surprise, both
packages were difficult to use and, worse, they failed to perform
routine tasks on their first day of use. The advertised ability to
import my Delta files didn't work either. Tech support acknowledged the
problems, but the only solution offered was to wait for the next release
&quot;due out in a couple of months.&quot; That was unacceptable.</p>
<p>At the obvious signs of hyperventilation, I decided to stop breathing
for a while. I realized I would inevitably lose my Delta database and,
with it, all the whys and hows of every version of my software. I
decided that the next version control package I used would have to rely
on a database format that was standard, well documented, and humanly
auditable (plain text). Then I remembered RCS, &quot;Revision Control
System,&quot; the version control system bundled with every version of Unix.
I found a Windows implementation of RCS on the Net in no time, and all
the tests I performed ran fine. RCS was open source, and I could use it
for my needs at no charge.</p>
<p>RCS's only weakness was its lack of network consciousness; this
eventually led me to CVS, the Concurrent Versioning System. CVS is open
source software, it is licensed under the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
License</a> and has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cyclic.com/">Cyclic
Software</a> as its official maintainer. CVS is
very network conscious, it supports collaborative (no locks) check-ins
and check-outs and branching, and is the primary version control package
used for open source projects all over the Net. Most importantly, CVS
uses the RCS file format, an open specification of version control
databases held in plain text.</p>
<p>I've used CVS for my version control needs for years, and it has
always performed flawlessly. The free upgrades have simplified the
installation and made important performance improvements. More than once
I've queried the CVS source code to see how things really work; it
helped me implement my Java RCS library (open source), which I wrote in
order to guarantee that I would never lose my version control
information again.</p>
<p>Individual developers may have reasons of their own to resist open
source, but sometimes it is the best solution to a business need. I'm
still paranoid about version control, so I plan to release my RCS
library as open source.</p>
